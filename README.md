# JihyeKimWP – Custom WordPress Theme

This is a highly customized WordPress theme originally based on the **Supernormal** theme created by [Designbase](https://designbase.co.kr/about/).

While the initial structure and some design elements come from the original theme, **over 90% of this project has been redesigned and extended by me**, including entirely new features and pages.
